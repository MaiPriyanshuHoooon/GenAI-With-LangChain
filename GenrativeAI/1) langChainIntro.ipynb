       "AIMessage(content='The \"top 5\" used chord progressions in pop music can be a bit subjective, as variations and subtle nuances exist. However, based on common analysis and widespread use, here are 5 progressions that are undeniably foundational and appear in countless hits:\\n\\n**1. The I-V-vi-IV Progression (The \"Axis of Awesome\" Progression)**\\n\\n*   **Chords:** Tonic (I), Dominant (V), Submediant (vi), Subdominant (IV)\\n*   **Example in C Major:** C - G - Am - F\\n*   **Why it\\'s popular:** This is arguably *the* most ubiquitous progression in modern pop. It\\'s incredibly versatile, emotionally resonant, and creates a satisfying cycle. The movement from the stable tonic to the driving dominant, then the melancholic submediant, and finally the hopeful subdominant feels natural and leads back to the tonic beautifully. It\\'s been dubbed the \"Axis of Awesome\" for a reason, appearing in songs from Journey\\'s \"Don\\'t Stop Believin\\'\" to Adele\\'s \"Someone Like You\" and countless others.\\n\\n**2. The ii-V-I Progression**\\n\\n*   **Chords:** Supertonic (ii), Dominant (V), Tonic (I)\\n*   **Example in C Major:** Dm - G - C\\n*   **Why it\\'s popular:** This is a fundamental building block in jazz and classical music, and its influence bleeds heavily into pop. It creates a strong sense of resolution and forward motion. The ii chord (Dm in C major) functions as a pre-dominant, setting up the dominant (G) to pull strongly to the tonic (C). It\\'s often used as a turnaround or a section within a larger song. Think of the resolution at the end of many phrases in songs.\\n\\n**3. The I-IV-V Progression**\\n\\n*   **Chords:** Tonic (I), Subdominant (IV), Dominant (V)\\n*   **Example in C Major:** C - F - G\\n*   **Why it\\'s popular:** This is a classic and foundational progression that\\'s been around for decades, forming the backbone of rock and roll, blues, and early pop. It\\'s simple, direct, and creates a strong sense of progression. The movement from I to IV is a gentle lift, and the V chord provides the tension that resolves back to the I. It\\'s a workhorse for creating energetic and memorable melodies.\\n\\n**4. The I-vi-IV-V Progression**\\n\\n*   **Chords:** Tonic (I), Submediant (vi), Subdominant (IV), Dominant (V)\\n*   **Example in C Major:** C - Am - F - G\\n*   **Why it\\'s popular:** This progression is very similar to the first one (I-V-vi-IV) but with a different order, giving it a slightly different emotional feel. It often starts with a more grounded feeling (I), moves to a slightly more introspective or melancholic tone (vi), then builds anticipation (IV), and finally resolves strongly (V). It\\'s a very common and pleasing variation.\\n\\n**5. The I-IV-V-IV Progression**\\n\\n*   **Chords:** Tonic (I), Subdominant (IV), Dominant (V), Subdominant (IV)\\n*   **Example in C Major:** C - F - G - F\\n*   **Why it\\'s popular:** This progression offers a slight twist on the traditional I-IV-V. The return to the IV chord after the V creates a sense of lingering anticipation or a slightly less definitive resolution. It can create a feeling of yearning or a gentle push and pull. It\\'s often used to create a cyclical feel within a verse or chorus.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Keys:** These progressions are often presented in major keys, but they can be transposed to any key. The Roman numerals represent the scale degrees, not specific chords.\\n*   **Variations:** Pop music is full of creative musicians who play with these progressions. You\\'ll often find inversions, added notes (like 7ths), or borrowed chords that add color and complexity.\\n*   **Context is Key:** The emotional impact of a chord progression depends heavily on the melody, rhythm, instrumentation, and lyrics.\\n\\nThese five progressions are a fantastic starting point for understanding the harmonic language of pop music.

      "For Beethoven, the obvious ones are his Ninth Symphony, especially the \"Ode to Joy\" theme. Then there's the Moonlight Sonata, Pathétique Sonata, and Emperor Concerto. Also, the Fifth Symphony's opening four-note motif is iconic. Maybe the Violin Concerto and the Triple Concerto. I should list these with some context about each piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mozart, his Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major, especially the Andante movement, is very famous. The Symphony No. 40 in G minor is another staple. The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni have memorable overtures. His Clarinet Concerto and Requiem are also notable. Let me check if there are other key pieces I might be missing. The Jupiter Symphony from his Symphony No. 41 is a must. Oh, and maybe the Turkish March and the Eine kleine Nachtmusik.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should organize these into a list, maybe separate Beethoven and Mozart. For each piece, give the full title, opus or key, and a brief note on why it's famous. Make sure to mention their historical significance and maybe some performance aspects. Avoid being too technical, keep it accessible. Also, check if there are any other commonly cited pieces I might have overlooked. Maybe the Symphony No. 5 movement for Beethoven? Wait, the Fifth Symphony's first movement is definitely a big one. And the Moonlight Sonata's first movement is the most famous. For Mozart, the Clarinet Concerto in A major, KV 622, and the Piano Concerto No. 21. Also, the overture to The Magic Flute. Hmm, but maybe stick to the most universally recognized ones to keep the list concise. The user probably wants a top 10 or so for each composer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user didn't specify the number, but the example answer has a list for each. Let me make sure I'm not overlapping titles. Also, check for correct opus numbers and keys. For example, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is in D minor, and the Moonlight is in C# minor. Mozart's Symphony No. 40 is in G minor. The Piano Concerto No. 21 is in C major. Double-check these details to be accurate. Also, mention the genres: symphonies, concertos, sonatas, operas. Maybe include a note that both composers were influential in different ways—Beethoven as a bridge between classical and romantic, Mozart in the classical era.

      "content='<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking about the circle of fifths. Let me start by recalling what I know. The circle of fifths is a diagram that shows the relationships between the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys. \\n\\nFirst, I should explain that it\\'s a sequence of pitches or key signatures where each next key is a perfect fifth above the previous one. So, starting from C major, the next key would be G major, which is a fifth above C. Then D, A, E, and so on. Eventually, this sequence forms a circle because after 12 steps, you come back to C, but one octave higher.\\n\\nI need to mention how it\\'s used in music theory. For example, composers use it to modulate between keys smoothly because moving by fifths is considered the most natural progression. Also, each key in the circle has a specific number of sharps or flats in its key signature. Moving clockwise adds a sharp (or subtracts a flat), while moving counterclockwise adds a flat (or subtracts a sharp). \\n\\nWait, the user might not know about key signatures. I should clarify that. Starting from C major, which has no sharps or flats, each step clockwise adds a sharp. For example, G major has one sharp (F#), D major has two sharps (F#, C#), etc. On the other side, when moving counterclockwise from C, you end up with keys that have flats. F major has one flat (Bb), Bb major has two flats (Bb, Eb), and so on.\\n\\nAnother important point is the relationship between major and minor keys. Each major key has a relative minor key that shares the same key signature. The circle of fifths also includes these minor keys. For example, A minor is the relative minor of C major. Maybe I should explain that the circle can show both major and minor keys, or perhaps focus on major first and then mention the minors.\\n\\nAlso, the circle of fifths is used in chord progressions. The dominant (V) chord of a key is a perfect fifth above the tonic (I), so the circle helps in understanding these progressions. Like in C major, the V chord is G, which is a fifth above C. This is why the circle is useful for composers and musicians to find related keys and create smooth transitions.\\n\\nI should also mention the visual representation—a circle with 12 sections, each labeled with a key, and how they connect. The clockwise direction is sharps, counterclockwise is flats. The key of C is usually at the top. Maybe mention the order of sharps and flats as they are added. Sharps are added in the order F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#, while flats are added in Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, etc. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The order of sharps is F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#. The order of flats is the reverse: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb, Fb. But maybe the user doesn\\'t need the exact order unless they\\'re asking for that specifically.\\n\\nAlso, the circle of fifths can help in identifying key signatures quickly. If you\\'re in a key with, say, three sharps, you can find where on the circle that key is located. The key with three sharps would be A major, since starting from C (0 sharps), adding three sharps gets you to A (F#, C#, G#). Similarly, three flats would be Eb major (Bb, Eb, Ab).\\n\\nAnother application is in transposing music. If a song is in C major with no sharps or flats and you want to transpose it to G major, you can see that G is one step clockwise on the circle, so you add one sharp. This helps in changing keys without confusion.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should also explain why it\\'s called the circle of fifths. Because each step is a perfect fifth interval, and after 12 steps, you circle back to the starting note, hence a circle. But since 12 perfect fifths don\\'t exactly equal seven octaves, there\\'s a slight discrepancy (the Pythagorean comma), but in equal temperament tuning, this is adjusted so the circle closes perfectly. However, that\\'s more advanced and might not be necessary for the basic explanation.\\n\\nI should also mention that the circle of fifths is essential for understanding key relationships, modulation, and for musicians to play in different keys. It\\'s a fundamental tool in music theory for both sight-reading and composition.\\n\\nLet me check if I missed anything. The user might also be interested in how it relates to the chromatic scale or other concepts. But sticking to the basics for now. Also, maybe give an example: starting at C, moving up a fifth to G, then up a fifth to D, etc. Show the sequence until it loops back.\\n\\nYes, and the fact that each adjacent key on the circle is closely related, sharing many common notes. For example, C major and G major share all but one note (F# vs. F natural), making them closely related keys. This makes modulating between them relatively easy.\\n\\nI think that\\'s a solid overview. Now, structure it in a clear, step-by-step explanation, starting with a definition, then breaking down the components, applications, and maybe an example or two.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe **circle of fifths** is a fundamental concept in music theory that visually and mathematically represents the relationships between the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys. Here\\'s a structured breakdown:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Structure of the Circle of Fifths**\\n- **Sequence of Keys**: Each key is a *perfect fifth* apart (e.g., C → G → D → A → E, etc.). After 12 steps, the sequence loops back to the starting key (C), forming a circle.\\n- **Key Signatures**:\\n  - **Clockwise (Sharps)**: Moving right from C major adds one sharp per step. Example: C (0 sharps) → G (1 sharp, F#) → D (2 sharps, F#, C#) → A (3 sharps, F#, C#, G#), etc.\\n  - **Counterclockwise (Flats)**: Moving left from C major adds one flat per step. Example: C (0 flats) → F (1 flat, Bb) → Bb (2 flats, Bb, Eb) → Eb (3 flats, Bb, Eb, Ab), etc.\\n- **Visual Representation**: A circular diagram with C at the top, keys arranged clockwise (sharps) and counterclockwise (flats).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Key Relationships**\\n- **Closely Related Keys**: Adjacent keys on the circle share the most notes. For example:\\n  - **C major** (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and **G major** (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#) share six notes (only F#/F natural differs).\\n  - This makes modulation (key changes) smoother between adjacent keys.\\n- **Relative Major/Minor Keys**: Each major key has a relative minor key with the same key signature (e.g., C major and A minor both have 0 sharps/flats).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Applications**\\n- **Chord Progressions**: Dominant (V) chords resolve to the tonic (I) by a perfect fifth. For example, in C major, G (V) resolves to C (I). The circle helps identify these relationships.\\n- **Key Signatures**: Quickly determine the number of sharps or flats for a key:\\n  - **Sharps**: The key of **G major** (1 sharp) shares the same key signature as **E minor**.\\n  - **Flats**: The key of **F major** (1 flat) shares the same key signature as **D minor**.\\n- **Transposition**: Easier to transpose music between keys by following the circle (e.g., C major to G major adds one sharp).\\n- **Modulation**: Composers use the circle to transition between keys smoothly (e.g., from C to G to D).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Example Walkthrough**\\n- Start at **C major** (0 sharps/flats).\\n  - Move **clockwise** (sharps): C → G (1 sharp) → D (2 sharps) → A (3 sharps) → E (4 sharps)... until returning to C.\\n  - Move **counterclockwise** (flats): C → F (1 flat) → Bb (2 flats) → Eb (3 flats) → Ab (4 flats)... until returning to C.\\n- **Relative Minors**: For every major key, the relative minor is located **three steps counterclockwise** (e.g., C major → A minor).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Why It’s Called \"Circle of Fifths\"**\\n- Each step in the sequence is a *perfect fifth* interval. After 12 fifths (in just intonation), the pitch cycles back to the starting note, forming a closed loop. In equal temperament tuning, this discrepancy is resolved, making the circle \"perfect.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **6. Practical Uses for Musicians**\\n- **Reading Music**: Quickly identify key signatures and scales.\\n- **Composing/Arranging**: Find related keys for modulation and harmonically rich progressions.\\n- **Improvisation**: Navigating chord changes and scales in different keys.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy understanding the circle of fifths, musicians gain a powerful tool for analyzing, composing, and performing music across all styles. 🎶' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2068, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 2083, 'completion_time': 5.430977017, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000419005, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.159935269, 'total_time': 5.431396022}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2bfcc54d36', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019bb224-1a73-70c3-96a1-a377e5491920-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 2068, 'total_tokens': 2083}\n",
      "content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative minor of D major. Hmm, I remember that relative majors and minors share the same key signature. Let me think... The relative minor is a minor key that has the same key signature as the major key. So if D major is the major key, its relative minor would be the minor key with the same number of sharps or flats.\\n\\nFirst, let me recall the key signature of D major. D major has two sharps: F# and C#. So the relative minor should also have two sharps. Now, how do I find the relative minor? I think it's a sixth interval below the major key. Wait, or is it a third above? Let me get this straight. The relative minor is the sixth note of the major scale. So if I take D major and find its sixth note, that should be the tonic of the relative minor.\\n\\nLet's build the D major scale to check. The D major scale is D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#. The sixth note here is B. So the relative minor of D major should be B minor. Let me verify. B minor's key signature is the same as D major, which has two sharps (F# and C#). That makes sense because in the B natural minor scale, the accidentals would be the same as D major. \\n\\nWait, but I should also consider the formula for the natural minor scale. The natural minor scale is the Aeolian mode. The relative minor is a minor third below the major key? No, wait, the relative minor is a minor third above the major key? No, I'm getting confused. Let me go back. The correct way is that the relative minor is the sixth degree of the major scale. So in D major, the sixth degree is B, so B minor is the relative minor. \\n\\nAlternatively, another way to find it is to count down a minor third from the major key. Let's see, D down a minor third is B. So that also gives B minor. Yes, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the relative minor of D major is B minor. \\n\\nJust to double-check, B minor's key signature is two sharps (F# and C#), which matches D major's key signature. So yes, they are relative keys. Therefore, the answer should be B minor.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe relative minor of **D major** is **B minor**. \\n\\n### Key Details:\\n- **D major** has **2 sharps** (F# and C#).\\n- **B minor** shares the same key signature (2 sharps), making them **relative keys**.\\n- The relative minor is found by identifying the **6th note** of the D major scale (D, E, **F#, G, A, B, C#**), which is **B**.\\n- Alternatively, it can be calculated by going **a minor third below** D (D → B).\\n\\nThis relationship ensures both keys use the same set of notes without altering the key signature. 🎶\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 640, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 655, 'completion_time': 1.413637741, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000716609, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.052342195, 'total_time': 1.41435435}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019bb224-1a78-7a51-bba3-ac6f11e47a34-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 640, 'total_tokens': 655}\n",
      "content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to explain how borrowed chords work in music theory, specifically using the key of C as an example. Let me start by recalling what I know about borrowed chords. From what I remember, borrowed chords are chords that come from a different key, usually the parallel key. For example, if you\\'re in C major, the parallel key would be C minor. So, borrowing chords from C minor would mean using chords that are diatonic to C minor but not to C major.\\n\\nWait, but how exactly does that work? So, in C major, the key signature has no sharps or flats. The diatonic chords in C major are built on each scale degree. Let me list them out. The diatonic chords in C major would be I (C major), ii (D minor), iii (E minor), IV (F major), V (G major), vi (A minor), and vii° (B diminished). \\n\\nNow, the parallel key is C minor. The natural minor scale of C minor has a key signature of 3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab. The diatonic chords in C natural minor would be i (C minor), ii° (D diminished), III (E major), iv (F minor), v (G minor), VI (A major), and VII (B major). Wait, but when talking about harmonic minor or melodic minor, the chords might be different. However, for borrowed chords, I think it\\'s usually the natural minor scale that\\'s considered unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nSo, borrowing a chord from the parallel minor would mean taking chords from C minor and using them in a C major key. For example, the iv chord in C minor is F minor. In C major, the IV chord is F major. So if I use F minor in a C major context, that\\'s a borrowed chord. Similarly, the III chord in C minor is E major, which in C major would be the iii chord as E minor. Using E major in C major would be a borrowed chord.\\n\\nBut how do you denote borrowed chords? I think they are labeled with a lowercase letter if they come from the minor key. Wait, no, maybe they are labeled with a \"b\" prefix or something else. Let me think. When you borrow a chord from the parallel minor, you can indicate it by using the diatonic chord from the minor key. For example, in C major, if you use the iv chord from C minor (which is F minor), you might call it iv° (even though in minor keys, iv is minor, but in major keys, IV is major). Wait, maybe the notation is just using the Roman numeral from the minor scale but indicating it\\'s borrowed. Like maybe using the Roman numeral with a lowercase letter and a \"b\" in front? Or perhaps just using the standard Roman numeral but specifying the key.\\n\\nAlternatively, in some sources, borrowed chords are indicated by using the Roman numeral from the parallel key and adding a \"b\" prefix. For example, F minor would be iv° in C minor, but since we\\'re in C major, it\\'s called iv° (borrowed) or maybe iv° (from C minor). I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the notation here. Maybe the standard is just to call it by the Roman numeral it would be in the minor key, but with a prefix like \"b\" or \"m\" to indicate minor. For example, the F minor chord is the iv chord in C minor, so in C major, it\\'s called ivm or iv°, but since in C major the IV is major, using iv minor is the borrowed chord.\\n\\nLet me check an example. If I\\'m in C major and I want to use a borrowed chord from C minor, let\\'s take the VI chord. In C minor, the VI chord is A major (since the 6th note is A, and in C minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So the A major chord would be A, C#, E? Wait, no. Wait, in C natural minor, the 6th scale degree is A, and the chord built on A would be A minor? Let me recalculate. The C natural minor scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. So the A chord would be A, C, E. Wait, A is the 6th note. The chord built on A is A minor (A, C, E). But in the natural minor, the VI chord is minor. But in harmonic minor, the 6th is raised to A#, but that\\'s a different scale. Hmm, maybe I confused the VI chord. Wait, in C minor, the diatonic chords are i (C minor), ii° (D diminished), III (E major), iv (F minor), v (G minor), VI (A major?), wait, no. Let me redo this. \\n\\nThe natural minor scale for C is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. The diatonic chords are:\\n\\ni (C minor): C, Eb, G\\n\\nii° (D diminished): D, F, Ab\\n\\nIII (E major): E, G, Bb\\n\\niv (F minor): F, Ab, C\\n\\nv (G minor): G, Bb, D\\n\\nVI (A major): A, C, E\\n\\nVII (Bb major): Bb, D, F\\n\\nWait, but the chord built on the 6th degree (A) would be A major? Because A, C, E. The intervals are A to C is a minor third, C to E is a major third. So A minor? Wait, A, C, E. A to C is minor third, C to E is major third. So that\\'s a minor triad. Wait, A minor? But in the key of C minor, the VI chord is A minor? Wait, but if the scale is C minor natural, the 6th note is A, and the chord built on A is A minor. Because the third is C, which is a minor third above A. So VI is A minor. But in some cases, like in harmonic minor, the 6th note is raised, which would change the chord. But for natural minor, the VI chord is A minor. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\\n\\nBut in the example I gave, if I use the VI chord from C minor in C major, which is A minor, but in C major, the VI chord is A minor as well. Wait, but in C major, the VI chord is A minor. So borrowing that from C minor? Hmm, maybe I need a different example. Let\\'s take the iii chord from C minor. In C minor, the III chord is E major (E, G, Bb), whereas in C major, the iii is E minor (E, G, B). So using E major in C major would be a borrowed chord. That\\'s a good example.\\n\\nAnother example is the iv chord in C minor, which is F minor. In C major, the IV is F major. So using F minor in C major is a borrowed chord. Also, the VII chord in C minor is Bb major (Bb, D, F). In C major, the vii° is B diminished (B, D, F). So using Bb major in C major is a borrowed chord. Wait, but Bb is not in the key of C major. So that chord would be Bb major, which has a Bb, D, and F. In C major, B is natural, but here it\\'s Bb. So that\\'s a chromatic chord, hence a borrowed one.\\n\\nSo the concept is that you take chords from the parallel minor (or sometimes parallel major) and use them in your current key, creating a chromatic effect. These chords are called borrowed chords because they\\'re taken from a different key. The most common borrowed chords are the bVII (in C major, that would be Bb major from C minor), the iv minor (F minor in C major), and the III major (E major in C major). These are called modal mixture. For example, in C major, borrowing from C minor, you can use the chords that are minor or major in the minor key but different in the major key.\\n\\nLet me think of how to structure the example. Let\\'s start with the key of C major and borrow from C minor. The first example could be using the iv minor chord (F minor) instead of the IV major. Another is using the bVII chord (Bb major) instead of the VII. Or the III major instead of iii minor. \\n\\nFor instance, in a I-IV-V-I progression in C major, you could replace the IV with iv minor, making it I-iv-V-I. That would be C-Fm-G-C. The Fm is the borrowed chord from C minor. Another example is using the bVII (Bb major) in a progression like I-bVII-IV-V. So C-Bb-F-G-C. The Bb chord is borrowed from C minor.\\n\\nAnother common borrowed chord is the bVI (Ab major in C major). Wait, in C minor, the VI chord is A minor, but if you use Ab major in C major, that\\'s from the parallel minor? Wait, maybe not. Let me check. The VI chord in C minor is A minor. To get Ab major, you\\'d need to go to C harmonic minor? Or maybe a different mode. Hmm, maybe I\\'m overcomplicating. The main borrowed chords from the parallel minor are iv, bVII, and III. \\n\\nLet me confirm the diatonic chords in C natural minor. The chords are:\\n\\ni (C minor)\\n\\nii° (D diminished)\\n\\nIII (E major)\\n\\niv (F minor)\\n\\nv (G minor)\\n\\nVI (A minor)\\n\\nVII (Bb major)\\n\\nSo the III chord is E major, which in C major is E minor. So E major is a borrowed chord. The iv is F minor, which in C major is F major. So F minor is borrowed. The VII chord is Bb major, which in C major is B diminished. So Bb major is borrowed as VII. \\n\\nSo in C major, the borrowed chords from C minor would be the III (E major), iv (F minor), and VII (Bb major). Additionally, the VI chord in C minor is A minor, which is the same in C major, so that\\'s not a borrowed chord. The ii° in C minor is D diminished, but in C major, the ii is D minor, so the D diminished is a borrowed chord (ii° in minor). \\n\\nSo, to give examples, using E major (III) instead of E minor (iii), using F minor (iv) instead of F major (IV), and using Bb major (VII) instead of B diminished (vii°). \\n\\nFor instance, a common progression in pop music is I-bVII-IV-V. In C major, that would be C-Bb-F-G. The Bb chord is the borrowed VII from C minor. Another example is using the iv minor chord in a progression like I-iv-V-I: C-Fm-G-C. \\n\\nAnother example is the use of the III major chord in a context where the iii minor would typically be used. For example, in a progression like C-E-G-C, but instead of E minor, you use E major. \\n\\nSo the key idea is that borrowed chords add color and chromaticism by using chords from the parallel minor key, which have different qualities than their counterparts in the major key. This creates a richer harmonic palette and is often used to add surprise or to modulate between keys.\\n\\nWait, but how exactly are these chords borrowed? Is it because they are not diatonic to the original key? Yes, because in C major, F minor is not a diatonic chord; F major is. So using F minor introduces a chromatic note (Ab instead of A natural?), Wait, F minor is F, Ab, C. In C major, the F major is F, A, C. So the Ab is a chromatic note, which is the third of the F minor chord. So when you use F minor in C major, you\\'re introducing an Ab, which is not in the key of C major. Similarly, the E major chord has a G#? No, in C minor, the E chord is E, G, Bb. Wait, in C minor, the III chord is E major. The notes would be E, G#, B. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in C minor, the scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Wait, no, in natural minor, the notes are C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. So the III chord is built on E? Wait, the third note of the natural minor scale is Eb. Wait, no, the natural minor scale is C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. The third note is Eb. So the III chord would be Eb major? Wait, no. Let me correct this. The diatonic chords in natural minor are:\\n\\ni: C minor (C, Eb, G)\\n\\nii°: D diminished (D, F, Ab)\\n\\nIII: Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)\\n\\niv: F minor (F, Ab, C)\\n\\nv: G minor (G, Bb, D)\\n\\nVI: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)\\n\\nVII: Bb major (Bb, D, F)\\n\\nWait, that\\'s different. So the III chord in C natural minor is Eb major, not E. So earlier, I made a mistake. The III chord is Eb major. Therefore, in C major, borrowing the III chord from C minor would be Eb major? Wait, but Eb is not in the key of C major. Wait, but C major\\'s key signature is no sharps or flats. Eb is a flat, which is not in C major. So using Eb major in C major would be a borrowed chord. But that seems different from what I thought before. Maybe I confused the III chord in natural minor. Let me recast all chords in C natural minor correctly.\\n\\nC natural minor scale: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb.\\n\\nChords built on each degree:\\n\\ni: C minor (C, Eb, G)\\n\\nii°: D diminished (D, F, Ab)\\n\\nIII: Eb major (Eb, G, Bb)\\n\\niv: F minor (F, Ab, C)\\n\\nv: G minor (G, Bb, D)\\n\\nVI: Ab major (Ab, C, Eb)\\n\\nVII: Bb major (Bb, D, F)\\n\\nSo the III chord in C natural minor is Eb major. So in C major, the III chord is E minor (E, G, B). Therefore, borrowing the III chord from C minor would be Eb major. So in C major, using Eb major as a chord would be a borrowed chord. But that\\'s a different chord than what I thought earlier. So maybe I made a mistake earlier when talking about E major. That was incorrect. The correct III chord in C natural minor is Eb major, not E major. So that changes things.\\n\\nSo, in that case, the borrowed chords from C minor (natural) into C major would include:\\n\\n- III: Eb major (which is a major chord built on Eb, which is not in C major)\\n\\n- iv: F minor (Ab is not in C major)\\n\\n- VII: Bb major (Bb is in C major only as a key signature flat, but in C major, the vii° is B diminished, so Bb major is a different chord)\\n\\n- VI: Ab major (Ab is not in C major)\\n\\nSo the common borrowed chords from C minor into C major are iv (F minor), VII (Bb major), and III (Eb major). Also, VI (Ab major) is another one. So for example, using Ab major in C major would be a VI chord from C minor.\\n\\nSo, putting this into examples. Let\\'s take the key of C major and use some borrowed chords.\\n\\n1. Using the iv minor chord (F minor) instead of IV major. So in a progression like C-F-G-C, the F is minor. The F minor chord has an Ab, which is not in C major. This is a common borrowed chord.\\n\\n2. Using the VII chord (Bb major) instead of the vii°. For example, C-Bb-G-C. Here, the Bb chord is borrowed from C minor. In C major, the vii° is B diminished (B, D, F), so using Bb major instead introduces a chromatic element.\\n\\n3. Using the III chord (Eb major) instead of the iii minor (E minor). For example, C-Ebm-G-C. The Eb major chord (Eb, G, Bb) is borrowed from C minor.\\n\\n4. Using the VI chord (Ab major) instead of the VI in C major, which is A minor. So in a progression like C-Ab-F-G-C. The Ab major chord (Ab, C, Eb) is from the C minor scale.\\n\\nThese borrowed chords add color and can create a sense of modulation without actually changing key. They are often used for emotional effect, like to introduce a darker or more dramatic sound in a major key.\\n\\nAnother example is the use of the bVII chord in rock and pop music. For instance, the progression C-Bb-F-G-C. The Bb chord is a bVII from C minor, adding a bluesy or rock flavor.\\n\\nSo, in summary, borrowed chords are chords taken from the parallel minor key and used in the major key context. They are chromatic chords that add variety and interest. The key is to identify the parallel minor key, determine the chords in that key, and then use them where appropriate in the original major key. The most common borrowed chords are the iv minor, bVII major, and III major (from the natural minor), but others like VI can also be used.\\n</think>\\n\\nBorrowed chords are chromatic chords borrowed from the **parallel minor key** (or vice versa) and used in the original key to add color, tension, or emotional depth. In the key of **C major**, the parallel minor is **C minor natural**. By borrowing chords from C minor, we introduce chromaticism that enriches the harmonic palette.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **How Borrowed Chords Work in C Major**\\n1. **Identify the Parallel Minor Key**:  \\n   The parallel key to C major is **C minor natural**, which has the key signature: **B♭, E♭, A♭** (three flats).\\n\\n2. **List Diatonic Chords in C Minor**:\\n   - **i** (C minor): C – E♭ – G  \\n   - **ii°** (D diminished): D – F – A♭  \\n   - **III** (E♭ major): E♭ – G – B♭  \\n   - **iv** (F minor): F – A♭ – C  \\n   - **v** (G minor): G – B♭ – D  \\n   - **VI** (A♭ major): A♭ – C – E♭  \\n   - **VII** (B♭ major): B♭ – D – F  \\n\\n3. **Compare to C Major Chords**:\\n   - In C major, the **IV** chord is **F major** (F – A – C), but in C minor, it’s **F minor** (F – A♭ – C).  \\n   - The **bVII** chord in C major is **B♭ major** (B♭ – D – F), which is the **VII** chord in C minor.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Common Borrowed Chords in C Major**\\n1. **iv° (F minor)**  \\n   Replaces the **IV major** (F major) in C major.  \\n   **Example**:  \\n   Progression: **C – Fm – G – C**  \\n   The Fm chord (F – A♭ – C) introduces a chromatic A♭, creating a darker, introspective sound.\\n\\n2. **bVII (B♭ major)**  \\n   Replaces the **B diminished** chord in C major.  \\n   **Example**:  \\n   Progression: **C – B♭ – F – G – C**  \\n   The B♭ chord (B♭ – D – F) adds a bluesy or rock-infused flavor.\\n\\n3. **III (E♭ major)**  \\n   Replaces the **iii minor** (E minor) in C major.  \\n   **Example**:  \\n   Progression: **C – E♭ – G – C**  \\n   The E♭ chord (E♭ – G – B♭) creates a rich, unexpected harmony.\\n\\n4. **VI (A♭ major)**  \\n   Replaces the **A minor** chord in C major.  \\n   **Example**:  \\n   Progression: **C – A♭ – F – G – C**  \\n   The A♭ chord (A♭ – C – E♭) adds a dramatic, chromatic twist.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Applications in Music**\\n- **Emotional Contrast**: Borrowed chords often evoke a shift in mood. For example, using **Fm** in C major introduces a minor-key melancholy.  \\n- **Modulation**: Borrowed chords can act as pivot chords to transition to the parallel minor.  \\n- **Popular Progressions**:  \\n  - **I – bVII – IV – V** (e.g., C – B♭ – F – G): Common in rock and pop (e.g., \"Sweet Child O’ Mine\" by Guns N’ Roses).  \\n  - **I – iv – V – I** (e.g., C – Fm – G – C): Adds tension and resolution with the iv minor.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Takeaway**\\nBorrowed chords leverage the parallel minor’s unique harmonies to inject chromaticism into a major key. By understanding the diatonic chords of C minor, you can identify and apply these borrowed chords to create dynamic, expressive progressions in C major.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4697, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 4724, 'completion_time': 11.217036034, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.00088428, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.15987005, 'total_time': 11.217920314}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2bfcc54d36', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019bb224-1a79-7e63-853d-3c8ae38b3a14-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 4697, 'total_tokens': 4724}\n"
